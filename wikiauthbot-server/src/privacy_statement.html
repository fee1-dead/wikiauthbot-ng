<h1>Privacy Statement of WikiAuthBot2</h1>
<h2>Information we collect</h2>
<p>
    Upon authenticating to your Wikimedia account via the /auth command, we store your Discord user ID and your
    Wikimedia CentralAuth ID.
</p>
<p>
    This information will be retained indefinitely unless you use /deauth on all servers that use WikiAuthBot2, after which
    the information will be deleted.
</p>
<p>
    We use this information such that Discord identities can be linked to Wikimedia identities for the purpose of identification,
    server moderation, authentication to channels with privileged access, etc. 
</p>

<h2>How we protect your information</h2>
<p>
    Regular queries refer to queries issued by a user on a server about themselves or other users
    via the use of commands including /whois, /revwhois, etc, as well as access to the data through
    a web API provided to limited trusted applications that access data on a server after approval
    by the server's owner.
</p>
<p>
    The relationship between your Discord account and your Wikimedia account will not be automatically available
    or revealed to regular queries on new servers you join. Servers that use WikiAuthBot2 will not know of this
    relationship until you authenticate via /auth to the specific server.
</p>

<h2>Access to your information</h2>

<p>
    Besides regular queries, your information are available to developers of WikiAuthBot2, which are bound by
    the <a href="https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikitech:Cloud_Services_Terms_of_use"><!--
-->Wikimedia Cloud Services Terms of Use for Administrators and Developers</a>.
    The information may also be available to the Wikimedia Foundation, volunteer administrators,
    or other WMCS developers.
</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>
    WMCS is hosted and operated in the United States. By using WikiAuthBot2, you acknowledge and understand
    that collection, use, storage, and other processing of your information (personal or otherwise) as outlined
    in this Privacy Statement will take place in the United States. You understand that your information also
    may be transferred to other countries, and that the United States and such other countries may have different
    or less stringent data protection laws than your country. Furthermore, you acknowledge that your Personal
    Information will be governed by this Privacy Statement, rather than the Wikimedia Foundation's Privacy Policy.
